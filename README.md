#Bike sharing predictions using Linear regression


## Table of Contents
* Jupyter notebook containing linear regression models
* Linear regression descriptive questions

<!-- You can include any other section that is pertinent to your problem -->

## General Information
You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Observed how demand for bike sharing changes with different predictors
